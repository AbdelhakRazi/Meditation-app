“I like to think of meditating the same way I think about exercise. Just like I don’t love all forms of exercise (I’ll never be a runner, but I love to bike and take yoga), I realized what works for some people won’t necessarily be what works for me. When I first began, I started out doing what one would think of as traditional meditation. Sitting legs crossed, hands in a mudra, and trying to quiet my mind by focusing on my breath.“It wasn’t that it was horrible. It was just that I couldn’t wait for the timer to go off, so I was never consistent with the practice. But my practice transformed when I found what I did enjoy: writing! I began a gratitude journal as a form of concentration that quiets my mind, and thanks to an article I read about smiling (Did you know your mind can’t tell the difference between a fake smile and a real one?), I created a practice. I set several alarms a day to smile and just breathe for one minute until the alarm goes off. Funny enough, after doing these practices that I actually enjoy, I am now a morning meditator, and I don’t wait for the timer. In fact, I look forward to seeing just how much I can completely relax each time!” —Rebecca, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
