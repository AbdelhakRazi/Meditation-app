“I used to think meditation was for yogis and bearded men who wear dresses. It wasn’t until I realized that meditating could solve my binge eating that I decided to try it. I heard that willpower is like a muscle and could be strengthened through meditation. The first time I tried was a disaster. I would start meditating and within three seconds be thinking about what I was going to make for dinner. It took practice, but now I love it! Like a muscle, willpower can grow, but it can also be fatigued. If willpower is like a cell phone battery, meditation is what charges it back up.” —Wendy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
