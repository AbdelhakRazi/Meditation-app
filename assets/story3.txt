“Meditating was hard at first, but I lost my meditation virginity on a random Saturday night. I decided to watch Netflix and relax instead of going out with my roommate … it just worked. It was surprisingly so easy! I had been putting it off because I felt like my mind was constantly go-go-go, but once you get the hang of it, it’s almost second nature.” —Danielle, Winston-Salem, North Carolina
