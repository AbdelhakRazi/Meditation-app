“I cannot say for certain what one specific thing made meditation work for me. I think I was just so desperate to find a solution to relearn how to sleep and calm down. I had faith that because so many people were doing it, it would work for me—and it has done so, beautifully. Learning to meditate has cured me of eight years of chronic insomnia for which I used to take Ambien, which I now no longer need.” —Mary, Austin, Texas
