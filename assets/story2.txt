“To help me get comfortable meditating, I took the word meditation out of my vocabulary. Somehow it seems less intimidating this way, kind of like instead of working out and/or exercise, one could say, ‘I am going to move my body for 30 minutes.’ It opens up a world of possibilities and helps me broaden my approach, therefore finding something I actually enjoy doing!” —Hillary, New York, New York
