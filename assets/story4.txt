“I used to try and meditate in the bed lying quietly for 20 minutes. I found my mind would wander, and I really wasn’t meditating. Then I read an article that talked about really absorbing the moment you are in, really exploring it with all your senses. Now I can go on my back deck in the morning, close my eyes, listen to the birds, and feel the sun on my neck … and I love meditating!” —Malika, Atlanta, Georgia
